# 🚨 Day 14: SOC Analyst Fundamentals – Part 1 (Introduction to SOC and SIEM)

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🔒 What is a SOC (Security Operations Center)?
- A centralized team responsible for monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity incidents.
- Operates 24/7 in shifts often called Blue Team.
- Tiered structure:
  - **Tier 1:** Alert monitoring and triage.
  - **Tier 2:** Deeper investigation of incidents.
  - **Tier 3:** Threat hunting, malware analysis, and proactive defense.

### 📊 Introduction to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

### ⚙️ Key SIEM Operations
- **Ingestion:** Collecting logs.
- **Normalization:** Structuring data to a standard format.
- **Correlation:** Matching related logs across sources to detect attacks.
- **Alerting:** Triggering warnings on suspicious behavior.
