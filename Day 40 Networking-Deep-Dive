##  Networking Rooms Completed on TryHackMe

- **Networking Concepts**  
  Learned about:
  - IP addresses, ports, packets
  - Protocols (TCP/UDP)  
  - How data flows through networks

-  **Networking Essentials**  
  Explored:
  - DNS (Domain Name System)
  - DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
  - NAT (Network Address Translation)
  - Basic routing principles

- **Networking Core Protocols**  
  Studied:
  - HTTP / HTTPS  
  - FTP  
  - SSH  
  - ICMP (Ping, Traceroute)

-  **Networking Secure Protocols**  
  Understood:
  - SSL/TLS  
  - SFTP  
  - HTTPS  
  - VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)





 Every protocol I studied today can either be:
 - a **doorway for attackers** (when misconfigured or left exposed), or  
 - a **defense mechanism** when hardened and used securely.
