# Day 6: Networking Basics 

## 🧠 What I Learned
- What is an IP address (IPv4 vs IPv6)
- MAC Address
- Subnet Mask
- Default Gateway
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- Types of IP Addresses (Private vs Public, Static vs Dynamic)
- What is DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Basic Networking Commands: ping, ip a, ifconfig, netstat

## 💻 Commands Practiced
```bash
ping google.com
ip a
ifconfig
netstat -r
traceroute google.com  # or tracert on Windows
nslookup google.com
```

## 📝 Notes
- IP is like a digital address to identify devices on a network.
- MAC is a unique hardware ID burned into the network card.
- Subnet Mask separates the network and host portions of an IP.
- DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.
- DHCP dynamically assigns IP addresses to devices.
