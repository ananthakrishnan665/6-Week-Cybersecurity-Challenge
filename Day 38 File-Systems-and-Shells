# Day 38 – My Cybersecurity Journey Understanding the operating system backbone — file systems, shells, and terminal power.



##  Key Linux System Folders I Explored

-  `/bin` – Essential system binaries  
-  `/etc` – System-wide configuration files  
- `/var` – Variable data like logs, mail, spool  
-  `/home` – User-specific directories  
-  `/dev` – Device files  

These folders are the structure that keeps **Linux organized and operational** — critical for defenders and attackers to understand.



##  Command Line Mastery

###  Completed:
- TryHackMe Room: **Command Line Basics**

###  Revision Topics:
-  Windows CMD basics  
-  PowerShell scripting & automation  
-  Linux Shells and their power in hacking, forensics, and automation

> These aren't just terminals — they’re **weapons** in ethical hacking, forensics, and cyber defense.

##  Reflection

Today I unlocked the real power behind the keyboard — the shell.  
Understanding **file systems and command lines** is not optional — it’s fundamental.  
This knowledge fuels scripting, automation, malware analysis, and forensic investigation.
