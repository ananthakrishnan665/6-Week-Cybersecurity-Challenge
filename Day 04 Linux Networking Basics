# ðŸ“… Day 4 - Linux Networking Commands (SOC Analyst Perspective)



##  Focus:
Today, I learned the core Linux networking commands that a **SOC Analyst** or cybersecurity expert uses to monitor and troubleshoot network issues.



##  Theory Concepts Covered:

- **IP Addressing**:  
  Learned how devices are identified in a network using IP addresses. Commands like `ip a` and `hostname -I` help to verify these.

- **Routing Table**:  
  Understood how Linux routes traffic and how `ip route` and `netstat -rn` help check the systemâ€™s path to different networks.

- **DNS Resolution**:  
  Grasped how domain names are translated into IPs using DNS. Tools like `dig` and `nslookup` are used to investigate DNS records.

- **Packet Flow and Latency**:  
  Learned how to track packet travel and delays using `ping` and `traceroute` â€” essential for identifying network bottlenecks or routing issues.

- **Interface Monitoring**:  
  Understood how to list and inspect all network interfaces using `ifconfig` and `ip a`.



##  Commands Practiced:

1. `ip a` â€“ Displays all IP addresses and interfaces.
2. `ip route` â€“ Shows routing table.
3. `hostname -I` â€“ Shows current IP address.
4. `ping google.com` â€“ Checks connection and latency.
5. `traceroute google.com` â€“ Traces the route taken by packets.
6. `nslookup google.com` â€“ Queries DNS for IP.
7. `dig google.com` â€“ Gets detailed DNS records.
8. `netstat -rn` â€“ Displays routing information.
9. `ifconfig` â€“ Shows legacy interface information.
