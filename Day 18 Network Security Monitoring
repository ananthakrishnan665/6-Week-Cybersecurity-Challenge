# 🛡️ Day 18: Network Security Monitoring 

## 📌 What I Learned

### 🔍 What is Network Security Monitoring
- NSM is the collection, analysis, and escalation of indications and warnings to detect and respond to intrusions.
- It's different from traditional IDS because it provides contextual data, not just alerts.

### 🧠 Core Concepts
- **Full Packet Capture** – Capturing every bit of data over a network.
- **Flow Data** – Summarized connection info (source IP, dest IP, ports, protocol).
- **Application Layer Metadata** – Logging HTTP, DNS, SSL data etc.



## 🛠️ Tool of the Day: Zeek (formerly Bro)

### ✅ What is Zeek?
- A powerful, flexible network analysis framework.
- Parses network traffic and generates logs from `.pcap` files.
- Not signature-based like Snort, instead it's behavioral.



### 🔧 Installed Zeek

sudo apt update
sudo apt install zeek
zeek -r sample.pcap
