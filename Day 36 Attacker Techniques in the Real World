## Day 36 Attacker Techniques in the Real World

Today, I didn’t just “study” — I understood how real-world cyberattacks actually happen.  
From phishing emails to privilege escalation, I explored how attackers think, move, and hide.



##  What I Learned

- **Phishing** isn’t just email spam — it’s how attackers breached MGM Resorts in 2023 using a fake LinkedIn message.
- **Living off the Land (LOTL)** — Like Volt Typhoon using built-in Windows tools (no malware!) to stay undetected.
- **Privilege Escalation** — Used tools like `winPEAS` and `GTFOBins` to simulate attackers gaining admin access.
- **PowerShell Abuse** — Learned how attackers encode payloads to run commands stealthily.
- **Web Exploits** —  XSS, SQL Injection, and Web Shells using OWASP Top 10 
- **Lateral Movement** — Studied attacker methods to move across networks using RDP, stolen hashes, and misconfigs.
- **Data Exfiltration** — Explored how data can be hidden and sent out via DNS traffic without raising alerts.



## Reflection

This wasn’t just another lab day  it was a mindset shift.  
I now think more like an attacker, which is the first step to becoming an elite defender.  
Everything I practiced is based on real-world attack patterns.
