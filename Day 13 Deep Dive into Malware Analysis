# ðŸ§  Day 13: Deep Dive into Malware Analysis Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Focus Areas:
- Static Analysis: File structure, signatures, strings
- Dynamic Analysis: Runtime behavior, system & network changes
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Sandboxing and behavioral monitoring
- Safe testing using EICAR malware test file



## ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
| Tool          | Purpose                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------|
| VirusTotal    | Multi-engine scan & basic static analysis |
| Hybrid Analysis | Threat score, dropped files, IOCs     |
| Any.Run       | Real-time behavioral malware analysis    |



## Activities Performed:

### 1. Static Analysis
- Uploaded EICAR test file to **VirusTotal**.
- Observed AV engine responses, hashes, and behavior tags.
- Collected basic IOCs.

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
- Used **Any.Run** to simulate malware execution.
- Monitored:
  - File changes
  - Registry edits
  - Network traffic



## ðŸ“˜ Key Learnings:
- Difference between static & dynamic analysis.
- Importance of safe environments (sandboxing).
- Practical IOC identification (IP, domain, file hash).
- Early malware detection = faster incident response.



## ðŸ”’ Notes:
> No real malware used. Only publicly safe samples like the EICAR test file for safe practice.
