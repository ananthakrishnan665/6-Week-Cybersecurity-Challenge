##Day 36 

Today I took a deep dive into the real structure of the Internet â€” and it blew my mind.  
Cybersecurity isnâ€™t just about hacking or tools â€” itâ€™s about understanding the terrain we're defending.



##  What I Explored

### How the Internet Works
- Submarine cables & optical fiber â€” the **physical backbone** connecting continents.
- How the Internet reaches users via the global structure:
- **ICANN â†’ IANA â†’ 5 RIRs**
- Example for India:  
    `ICANN â†’ IANA â†’ AFNIC â†’ IRINN â†’ ISPs â†’ End Users`



### The TOR Project
- Who runs **Tor servers** and how **onion routing** protects anonymity.
- Roles of **Entry Nodes**, **Middle Relays**, and **Exit Nodes**.
- Explored privacy-focused tools like:
- **Ahmia Search Engine**
- **Hidden Wiki Directories**



### Layers of the Web
- ðŸ©· The difference between:
  - **Surface Web** (indexed by Google)
  - **Deep Web** (login-protected content)
  - **Dark Web** (accessible via Tor)
  - Learned about:
  - Realities vs. myths â€” e.g., the **Silk Road** case
  - Ethical, legal, and technical implications



### Bonus Knowledge
- Learned about **Vint Cerf**, often called the *Father of the Internet*.



## Reflection
> Cybersecurity is not just about scanning ports or writing exploits.  
> It's about understanding the vast digital landscape â€” from fiber cables beneath oceans to anonymized networks above.  
> Today, I learned how deep this rabbit hole truly goes.
