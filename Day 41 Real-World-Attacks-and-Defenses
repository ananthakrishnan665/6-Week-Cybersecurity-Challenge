#  Day 41 – Real-World Attacks & Defenses: Bridging Theory and Practice  
 
# Tags: #RealWorldCyber #AttackAndDefense #HandsOnLearning



##  What I Worked On Today

Today I took a major step forward by completing hands-on modules focused on **real-world attack strategies** and **defensive responses** 
— simulating what actual threat actors and security teams deal with daily.


###  Simulated Real-World Attack Scenarios

-  **Credential Harvesting** – Capturing login credentials through phishing and exposed forms  
-  **Exploiting Weak Services** – Finding vulnerable services to gain initial access  
-  **Privilege Escalation** – Moving from low to high privilege access  
-  **Lateral Movement** – Spreading across systems once inside the network



###  Defensive Response Techniques Explored

-  **System Hardening** – Removing unnecessary services and tightening configurations  
-  **Network Monitoring & Log Analysis** – Using tools to detect anomalies and potential threats  
-  **Detecting IOCs** – Recognizing indicators of compromise in real-time environments  
-  **Patch Management & Access Control** – Preventing exploitation by managing vulnerabilities and permissions
