# 🌐 Day 8 – Introduction to Networking Fundamentals (Part 1)



## 🧠 Topics Learned:

### 🔸 What is a Network?
- A network is a group of connected devices that share data.
- Can be LAN (Local), WAN (Wide), MAN (Metro), etc.

### 🔸 IP Addressing
- **IPv4:** 32-bit, e.g., `192.168.1.1`
- **IPv6:** 128-bit, e.g., `2001:0db8.....`
- **Private IPs:** Used in local networks (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **Public IPs:** Globally unique IPs used on the internet
- **Static IPs:** Manually configured and fixed
- **Dynamic IPs:** Assigned via DHCP

### 🔸 Subnet Mask
- Determines the size of the network.
- Example: `255.255.255.0` means 256 IPs in a subnet.

### 🔸 MAC Address
- Hardware address burned into NIC
- Example: `00:0a:95:9d:68:16`

### 🔸 Gateway
- A device (usually a router) that connects a local network to other networks.

### 🔸 DNS (Domain Name System)
- Converts human-readable domains (e.g., google.com) to IP addresses.

### 🔸 Common Networking Devices
- **Router:** Connects different networks
- **Switch:** Connects devices within the same network
- **Hub:** Broadcasts data to all ports (obsolete)
- **Modem:** Connects a network to the internet

### 🔸 OSI Model (7 Layers)
1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

### 🔸 TCP/IP Model (4 Layers)
1. Network Interface
2. Internet
3. Transport
4. Application

## 🧪 Practice & Notes:
- Observed my own IP using `ip a` (Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows)
- Used `nslookup`, `ping`, `tracert` to explore DNS and routing
- Traced how packets move between devices
