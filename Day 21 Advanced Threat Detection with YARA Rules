# 🚨 Day 21 – Advanced Threat Detection with YARA Rules

## 🔍 Topic Overview:
YARA is a pattern-matching tool used for identifying and classifying malware. It helps analysts detect threats in files, memory, and processes using rule-based scanning.



## 🧠 What I Learned:

- What is YARA and why it's used in threat detection
- Structure of a YARA rule:
  - `meta` – descriptive tags
  - `strings` – strings to match
  - `condition` – logic that determines a match
- Creating and testing simple YARA rules
- Using `yara` CLI on Kali Linux
- Online tools for rule testing

## 🧪 Practical: Writing a YARA Rule

**Sample File:**
```bash
echo "This is a test with HelloWorld inside." > sample.txt
Rule File – rule.yar:
   rule HelloWorldRule {
    meta:
        description = "Detects HelloWorld string"
        author = "MyName"
    strings:
        $a = "HelloWorld"
    condition:
        $a
}
Command to scan:
  yara rule.yar sample.txt
