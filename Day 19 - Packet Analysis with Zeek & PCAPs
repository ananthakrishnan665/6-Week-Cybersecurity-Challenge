# âœ… Day 19: Packet Analysis with Zeek and PCAPs

ðŸŽ¯ **Objectives for Today:**
- Understand how to analyze network packets using **Zeek**
- Learn how to read **PCAP** files and extract insights
- Perform hands-on analysis to detect **suspicious traffic**



## ðŸ“˜ Theory Topics to Cover

### ðŸ”¹ What is a PCAP File?
- A `.pcap` (packet capture) file contains captured network data.
- Tools like **Wireshark** and **Zeek** are used to analyze them.

### ðŸ”¹ Zeek vs Wireshark:
| Feature    | Wireshark        | Zeek                           |
|------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Interface  | GUI-based        | CLI-based                      |
| Use Case   | Interactive      | Scalable, real-time monitoring |

### ðŸ”¹ Zeek Log Files:
- `conn.log`: All network connections seen
- `dns.log`: DNS requests and responses
- `http.log`: HTTP traffic details
- `weird.log`: Anomalous or unexpected behavior
- `notice.log`: Important security-related events

### ðŸ”¹ Common Indicators in Logs:
- Suspicious IP addresses
- High volume traffic
- Abnormal port usage
- Known malware-related behavior



## ðŸ’» Practical Tasks

### âœ… 1. Download & Analyze Sample PCAP with Zeek

sudo apt update && sudo apt install zeek -y
wget https://github.com/markbaggett/pcapfiles/raw/master/malware.pcap
mkdir zeek_analysis && cd zeek_analysis
zeek -r ../malware.pcap
ls
