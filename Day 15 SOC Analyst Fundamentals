# Day 15: SOC Analyst Fundamentals – Part 2 (SIEM & Hands-On Practice)

## 🔍 What I Learned

Today I deepened my understanding of SIEM tools and their vital role in the SOC environment.  
SIEMs help collect, normalize, and analyze logs in real-time, enabling faster detection and response.

### Key Concepts:
- What is SIEM and why it matters in security operations
- Log aggregation, normalization, correlation, and alerting
- False positive reduction through rule tuning
- SOC alert triage using SIEM dashboards

### 🛠️ Practical Task:
- Completed TryHackMe room: Splunk   
- Explored log queries, filtering, and dashboard usage
- Simulated triage of security alerts in Splunk

## 🔗 Tools Used
- Splunk
- TryHackMe - Splunk



## 📘 Notes
This was my first hands-on dive into SIEM tools, and it helped me understand how a SOC uses these platforms to triage and investigate alerts effectively. Looking forward to expanding on this in coming days.
