# 🚀 Day 10 – Wireshark & Network Packet Analysis

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Importance of Wireshark in analyzing network traffic
- How to capture live network packets
- Structure of packets (Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP → Application layer)
- Using display filters:
  - `ip.addr == 192.168.1.1`
  - `http`
  - `tcp.port == 80`
  - `dns`
- Recognizing suspicious or malicious traffic patterns
- Basics of protocol dissection

## 🧪 Commands & Filters Practiced
-ip.addr == [IP]
-tcp.port == 80
-http.request
-dns
-icmp
