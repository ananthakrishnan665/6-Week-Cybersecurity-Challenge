## ðŸ“… Day 33: Cloud Threat Detection, Response & Hands-On Practice

### ðŸ§  What I Learned:
- Identified and mapped common cloud threats (S3 data leaks, IAM misuse)
- Studied AWS GuardDuty and CloudTrail alert mechanisms
- Analyzed IAM and API access logs to identify suspicious behavior
- Understood incident response lifecycle in the cloud (isolate, revoke, rotate, report)
- Explored Falco and Wazuh for cloud-native detection in container environments


### ðŸ§° Tools Explored:
`GuardDuty`, `CloudTrail`, `Falco`, `Wazuh`, `MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Matrix`
