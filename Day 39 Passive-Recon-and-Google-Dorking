# Day 39 of My 6-Week SOC & Ethical Hacking Journey #Reconnaissance #GoogleDorking #PassiveRecon



##  Information Gathering – Passive Reconnaissance

Today I explored one of the most critical phases of ethical hacking:  
**Information Gathering** — the art of collecting data without touching the target directly.



##  What I Learned & Practiced

###  Passive Reconnaissance Techniques
- Used **public tools and sources** to gather data without alerting the target.
- Built intelligence on companies, subdomains, tech stacks, and exposure points — all without a single ping.



##  Tools I Explored

-  chaos.projectdiscovery.io](https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io) – Subdomain discovery  
- whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com) – Domain ownership & registrar info  
-  Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com) & [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com) – Identify technologies running behind websites  
-  `robots.txt` – Peek at restricted crawler directories  
- **Google Dorking** – Used advanced Google search operators to find:
- Exposed documents  
- Misconfigured login pages  
- Publicly indexed sensitive files



## Case Study Practice

Used **Tesla** and **Google** as targets (for research purposes) to apply recon techniques.  
The amount of information discoverable through passive means is **incredible** — no direct interaction needed.



##  Reflection

> Passive recon is a **silent but powerful** phase of ethical hacking.  
> It helps build the **attack surface blueprint** — crucial for planning real-world security assessments.  
> Today, I understood that *information is power* — especially when you know where to look.
